The culture medium is bright pink. The researcher removes the medium, rinses cells with PBS, fixes them with formaldehyde, then applies a keratin-specific staining reagent, turning differentiated keratinocytes a distinct orange-red color under the microscope. The camera focuses in close to show clear stained cells, highlighting different morphology before and after staining.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Keratinocyte Differentiation (Keratin Staining)\n2. Subject: Nature Science - Cell and Developmental Biology\n3. Experiment Objective: To observe keratinocyte differentiation through specific immunostaining of keratin proteins, understand cell differentiation markers and acquire basic techniques in cell fixation and staining.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nPetri dish with keratinocyte cultures, biosafety cabinet, micropipette, PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), 4% formaldehyde solution, keratin-specific primary antibody, secondary antibody conjugated with chromogenic reagent (e.g. HRP), staining buffer, microscope, sterile gloves, lab coat, waste disposal container.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Wear lab coat and gloves, work inside biosafety cabinet. Prepare all reagents and ensure sterile technique.\nCore Operation:\n1. Place the petri dish with cultured keratinocytes onto the work surface.\n2. Carefully aspirate the culture medium using a micropipette and dispose into liquid waste container.\n3. Rinse cells 2–3 times with PBS to remove residual medium.\n4. Add enough 4% formaldehyde to cover cells, incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature to fix.\n5. Wash cells 3 times with PBS.\n6. Add keratin-specific primary antibody diluted in staining buffer; incubate for 30 minutes.\n7. Wash cells with PBS.\n8. Add secondary antibody conjugated with chromogenic enzyme; incubate for 20 minutes.\n9. Wash with PBS, then add substrate to develop color for several minutes until orange-red cytoplasm is visible.\n10. Observe under microscope, noting morphology and staining intensity.\nConclusion Stage: Dispose of reagents appropriately; clean work area and store microscope slides.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Before staining: Keratinocytes appear transparent under microscope; cell boundaries visible; normal culture medium is pink.\n2. After staining: Differentiated keratinocytes display orange-red cytoplasm, undifferentiated cells remain lightly colored; cell shape and size differences are evident.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nKeratin is an intermediate filament protein characteristic of differentiated keratinocytes. When cells are fixed, antigenic sites are preserved. Specific antibodies bind keratin, and secondary antibodies linked with chromogenic enzymes produce a color reaction, allowing visual distinction between differentiated and undifferentiated cells. This immunocytochemical method is widely used in cell biology to study differentiation patterns.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. All steps should be done under sterile conditions to avoid contamination.\n2. Avoid drying cells during washes.\n3. Follow incubation times strictly to ensure optimal staining.\n4. Dispose of formaldehyde and staining reagents according to safety protocols."
