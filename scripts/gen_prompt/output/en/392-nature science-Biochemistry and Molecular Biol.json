    "generation_prompt": "Isolation and Purification of E. coli by Streak Plate Method: A laboratory bench with sterile Petri dishes containing solid nutrient agar under bright lighting. Wearing gloves and lab coat, a student uses a sterile inoculating loop to pick up an E. coli colony from a culture tube, then lightly streaks it across the agar surface in a zigzag pattern, rotating the plate each time to dilute the bacteria. The inoculating loop is sterilized by passing through a blue flame of a Bunsen burner between streaking. After streaking, the Petri dish is covered and labeled, then placed upside-down in an incubator set at 37°C. Time-lapse shows isolated circular colonies appearing after incubation—a clear demonstration of microbial isolation by dilution.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Isolation and Purification of E. coli by Streak Plate Method\n2. Subject: Nature Science - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n3. Experiment Objective: To understand aseptic technique, learn the streak plate method for obtaining isolated bacterial colonies, and grasp the basic principle of bacterial isolation through dilution by mechanical spreading.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nPetri dishes with solid nutrient agar medium, Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp, inoculating loop (nichrome wire loop), incubator (set to 37°C), marker pen, E. coli mixed culture tube, sterile gloves, lab coat, 70% ethanol.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Wipe down bench surface with 70% ethanol. Wear gloves and lab coat. Prepare Petri dishes containing solidified nutrient agar. Light Bunsen burner to maintain a sterile working zone.\nFlame Sterilization: Hold the inoculating loop in the flame until red-hot, then cool for a few seconds without touching any surface.\nSample Acquisition: Open the cap of an E. coli culture tube near the burner flame. Insert the cooled loop to obtain a small amount of bacterial culture from the tube. Re-close immediately.\nStreaking Operation: Lift the lid of an agar plate slightly near the flame. Streak the loop gently over approximately one-quarter of the plate surface in parallel lines. Flame and cool the loop again, rotate the plate about 90°, and streak from the edge of the first sector into the next, continuing for three or four quadrants to progressively dilute the inoculum.\nFinishing: After streaking, close the Petri dish, label with sample name, date, and initials. Invert the plate (agar side up) to prevent condensation droplets from falling onto the culture. Place it into the incubator at 37°C for 18–24 hours.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initial State: Plate surface smooth and transparent pale yellow.\n2. During incubation: Minor moisture visible on the lid; no colonies yet.\n3. After incubation (18–24 h): Numerous small, round colonies appear on the agar. The first streak area shows dense growth, while later sectors show clearly separated colonies. Colonies are round, slightly convex, with smooth edges and a milky or pale yellow appearance.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThe streak plate method is based on mechanical dilution of microbial cells on the agar surface. By flame-sterilizing the loop and streaking sequentially across different plate sectors, the bacterial load is reduced with each streak, ultimately separating individual cells that grow into distinct colonies. Each isolated colony originates from a single bacterial cell, representing a pure culture. This principle is fundamental for microbiological identification, purification, and further biochemical analyses.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Keep operation near the flame to prevent contamination.\n2. Allow the sterilized loop to cool before touching the culture to avoid killing bacteria.\n3. Do not open the plate for unnecessary periods; minimize airborne contamination.\n4. Correct labeling is crucial for result tracking.\n5. Dispose of used cultures through autoclaving or in accordance with biosafety regulations."
