    "generation_prompt": "Simulated Nuclear Reactor Coolant Boiling Point Test in Different Pressures: In a laboratory setting, a small transparent high-pressure vessel is placed on a sturdy bench, connected to a controllable pressure pump and thermometer probe. The vessel contains a measured amount of simulated reactor coolant (distilled water with additives). The operator gradually increases pressure from atmospheric to higher levels, then applies controlled heating with an electric heater. The boiling point is observed at each pressure level, with visible bubble formation starting later at higher pressures. The scene should clearly show the vessel, pressure gauge, thermometer, and gradual change in boiling behavior, with steam release when pressure is reduced.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Simulated Nuclear Reactor Coolant Boiling Point Test in Different Pressures\n2. Subject: Engineering - Nuclear Engineering\n3. Experiment Objective: To observe and measure the boiling point of simulated nuclear reactor coolant under varying pressures, understand the relationship between pressure and boiling point, and relate findings to reactor thermal-hydraulic safety principles.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\n- Transparent high-pressure vessel (rated for up to 5 atm)\n- Electric heating element with adjustable power\n- Pressure pump with gauge (0-5 atm)\n- Digital thermometer probe\n- Simulated reactor coolant (distilled water with corrosion inhibitor)\n- Safety goggles, heat-resistant gloves\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage:\n1. Place the high-pressure vessel securely on the lab bench.\n2. Fill vessel with measured volume of simulated coolant.\n3. Connect pressure pump and thermometer probe; check seals.\n4. Wear safety goggles and gloves.\n\nCore Operation:\n1. Record initial temperature and pressure (atmospheric).\n2. Apply heat gradually until boiling is observed; note temperature.\n3. Increase pressure to 2 atm using pump; allow system to stabilize.\n4. Apply heat again until boiling occurs; note temperature.\n5. Repeat for 3 atm.\n6. Reduce pressure back to atmospheric and observe boiling behavior change.\n\nObservation:\n- At atmospheric pressure: Boiling begins near 100°C with vigorous bubble formation.\n- At 2 atm: Boiling begins around 120°C, bubbles appear later and are smaller.\n- At 3 atm: Boiling begins near 133°C, bubble formation is delayed and less vigorous.\n- Upon pressure reduction: Sudden increase in boiling activity and steam release.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThe boiling point of a liquid increases with pressure due to the need for vapor pressure to match ambient pressure for phase change. In nuclear reactors, coolant under high pressure prevents boiling at operating temperatures, ensuring efficient heat transfer and avoiding vapor lock. This experiment simulates that principle, showing how pressure control is critical for reactor safety.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n- Ensure vessel and pump are rated for intended pressures.\n- Avoid rapid depressurization to prevent splashing.\n- Keep heating controlled to avoid overshoot.\n- Follow all lab safety protocols for high-pressure and high-temperature work."
