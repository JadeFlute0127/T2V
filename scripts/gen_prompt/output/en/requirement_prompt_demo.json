Place the clean test tube in the rack and put on goggles.\n2. Fill the test tube to one-third with copper sulfate solution.\n3. Using a dropper, slowly add sodium hydroxide solution while observing color and state changes.\n4. Gently shake the test tube to ensure even mixing.\n5. Observe the precipitate formation clearly and note its color and texture.\nPhenomena:\nInitially, the blue copper sulfate solution is transparent. Upon addition of sodium hydroxide, the solution immediately becomes cloudy, forming a light blue precipitate that settles gradually upon standing.\nPrinciples:\nCopper ions (Cu²⁺) react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) forming insoluble copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂). This is a typical double displacement reaction resulting in precipitation.\nCore Equation: CuSO₄ + 2 NaOH → Cu(OH)₂↓ + Na₂SO₄\nThis demonstrates inorganic reaction logic: when a soluble copper salt meets a strong base, the metal hydroxide precipitates and the sulfate remains dissolved.\nPrecautions:\nAvoid excess sodium hydroxide to prevent further reaction or misleading phenomena. Dispose of waste properly. Maintain safety and cleanliness in operation."

Experimental Equipment\nBeaker (100 mL), tripod, wire gauze, alcohol lamp, match or lighter, thermometer (optional), tongs, safety goggles.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\n1. Preparation: Place a clean beaker on the tripod and add several small white paraffin wax pieces. Put on safety goggles.\n2. Heating: Light the alcohol lamp and gently heat the bottom of the beaker through the wire gauze to ensure uniform heating.\n3. Observation: Watch the wax gradually soften, shrink, become translucent, and fully melt into a colorless transparent liquid.\n4. Cooling: Extinguish the lamp and allow the liquid wax to cool naturally until it resolidifies into an opaque white solid.\n5. Cleanup: Remove the beaker after cooling, wipe surfaces, and turn off the lamp safely.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initially: Solid paraffin wax is white and opaque.\n2. During heating: The wax softens, the edges melt first, forming a mixture of solid and liquid; then all turns transparent and liquid.\n3. During cooling: The liquid solidifies starting at the surface, becoming opaque again as its temperature drops.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nMelting of paraffin wax is a physical change representing solid–liquid phase transition. When heated, molecular motion strengthens, overcoming intermolecular forces until the wax melts at its melting point. Cooling reverses the process as energy dissipates and crystallization occurs. No new substance forms, demonstrating a reversible physical process.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Use gentle heating to avoid overheating or spattering.\n2. Do not touch molten wax directly; it retains heat well.\n3. Keep alcohol lamp stable and flame moderate.\n4. Ensure eye protection and lab safety at all times."

Basic Information\nTitle: Reaction of Carbon with Copper Oxide\nSubject: Chemistry – Inorganic Chemistry\nObjective: To demonstrate the redox reaction between carbon and copper(II) oxide, observe the color change from black to red, and understand reduction and oxidation principles.\nII. Equipment\nHard glass tube, test tube clamp and stand, Bunsen burner, copper(II) oxide powder (black), powdered or granular carbon, glass wool stoppers, and safety equipment (goggles, tongs).\nIII. Procedure\n1. Preparation: Wear safety goggles. Mix a small amount of copper(II) oxide and carbon lightly or place them sequentially at opposite ends inside the glass tube. Secure the tube horizontally on the clamp.\n2. Heating: Ignite the Bunsen burner and heat the section containing copper oxide steadily. Do not overheat the entire tube. Observe changes as heating continues.\n3. Observation: The black copper oxide gradually turns red-brown, indicating formation of metallic copper. Gas bubbles (carbon dioxide) move through the tube.\n4. Completion: Turn off the burner, allow the tube to cool, and inspect the red metallic deposit.\nIV. Observational Phenomena\n1. Before reaction: Copper(II) oxide is black; carbon appears gray or black.\n2. During heating: The copper(II) oxide changes color from black to red-brown while fine bubbles or slight gas flow are observed.\n3. After reaction: A red metallic layer of copper forms, and the reaction side no longer produces gas.\nV. Experimental Principle\nThis experiment demonstrates a redox reaction between carbon and copper(II) oxide. Carbon acts as a reducing agent, removing oxygen from copper(II) oxide to yield copper and carbon dioxide. Reaction equation: CuO + C → Cu + CO₂. The color change verifies reduction of copper ions to metallic copper.\nVI. Safety and Notes\n1. Use a small, controlled flame to avoid tube cracking.\n2. Allow apparatus to cool before touching.\n3. Avoid inhaling gas products; perform in a ventilated area.\n4. Dispose of residues properly after cooling.\nVII. Conclusion\nThis demonstration visually confirms the reduction of a metal oxide by carbon, illustrating fundamental oxidation-reduction concepts in inorganic chemistry."

Equipment: Test tube (150×20mm), delivery tube, rubber stopper, stand with clamp, beaker, water trough, anhydrous calcium chloride tube (as drying agent), zinc granules, dilute hydrochloric acid (1:3), safety goggles, lighter. III. Procedure: Preparation – Assemble apparatus ensuring airtight connections; place zinc granules in the generating test tube. Reaction – Add dilute hydrochloric acid gradually through a funnel; gas evolves immediately. Gas Drying – Pass generated gas through calcium chloride drying tube. Gas Collection – Collect dried hydrogen in the inverted test tube over water trough (downward displacement of air). Testing – After sufficient gas accumulation, bring a burning splint near the mouth of test tube; observe blue flame. Cleanup – After experiment, close acid bottle, neutralize residues, clean glassware, and store properly. IV. Observation: 1. Upon acid addition, bubbles form on zinc surface, gas flows through delivery tube. 2. Test tube collecting gas shows displacement of air; hydrogen burns with pale blue flame when ignited. V.

Upon adding base, solution turns pink. Adding acid returns it to colorless.\nPrinciple: Phenolphthalein is colorless in acidic or neutral solutions, pink in basic (pH > 8.2). Sodium hydroxide raises pH above transition range, causing pink; hydrochloric acid lowers pH, restoring colorless state.\nReaction Equations: NaOH → ↑OH⁻; OH⁻ shifts phenolphthalein to pink form. HCl → ↑H⁺; H⁺ neutralizes OH⁻, reverting to colorless."

Objective: Demonstrate amphoteric nature of Al(OH)3 through reaction with acid and alkali. Apparatus: Test tube, droppers, dilute HCl, NaOH solution, aluminum hydroxide precipitate sample, safety goggles. Procedure: (1) Place aluminum hydroxide suspension into a clean test tube. (2) Add a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid, gently shake—observe dissolution forming a clear solution. (3) Add a few drops of sodium hydroxide to the clear solution—observe white precipitate reappearing. (4) Clean apparatus afterward and dispose of waste properly. Observation: Initially white precipitate; after acid addition, becomes clear; after base addition, reappears white. Principle Summary: Aluminum hydroxide shows amphoteric behavior—it reacts with both acids and bases to form soluble salts or reincarnated precipitate. Reaction equations: Al(OH)3 + 3HCl → AlCl3 + 3H2O; Al(OH)3 + NaOH → Na[Al(OH)4]. Conclusion: The experiment demonstrates amphoteric character clearly and visually."

Experimental Equipment\nTest tube (1, 15×150mm), test tube rack, dropper, dilute hydrochloric acid solution (≈1 mol/L), sodium silicate solution (colorless, transparent), beaker for waste collection, safety goggles, gloves.\nIII. Experimental Procedure\n1. Preparation: Clean the test tube and place on rack. Put on safety goggles and gloves.\n2. Solution Setup: Pour about one-third volume of sodium silicate solution into the test tube.\n3. Core Operation: Using a dropper, add dilute hydrochloric acid slowly drop by drop to the sodium silicate solution.\n4. Observation: Observe changes in the appearance and texture of the solution during acid addition.\n5. Completion: When the solution becomes cloudy and forms a white gelatinous precipitate, stop adding acid.\n6. Cleanup: Pour waste into designated container and clean apparatus.\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Before Addition: The sodium silicate solution is colorless and transparent.\n2. During Addition: As drops of dilute hydrochloric acid mix in, a white gelatinous substance gradually appears, causing the mixture to become cloudy.\n3. After Reaction: The solution appears turbid and contains viscous white gel particles.\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThe experiment demonstrates the acid decomposition of a silicate compound. Sodium silicate reacts with hydrochloric acid, forming silicic acid (H₂SiO₃) and sodium chloride. Silicic acid is insoluble and polymerizes into a gelatinous white precipitate, giving the solution a cloudy appearance.\nReaction Equation: Na₂SiO₃ + 2HCl = H₂SiO₃↓ + 2NaCl\nThis shows the transition from soluble silicate to insoluble gel-like acid form under acidic conditions.\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Handle acid additions carefully to avoid splashing.\n2. Do not add excessive acid to prevent overheating or spray.\n3. Clean up promptly and dispose of solutions properly.\n4. Wear protective gear during the demonstration."

Preparation: Pour fuchsin solution into a clean beaker until one-third full; note its magenta color. Put on safety goggles.\n2. Gas Generation: Produce SO₂ gas by burning sulfur in a small combustion spoon under a funnel or use a gas cylinder output.\n3. Delivery: Connect the gas outlet to a glass delivery tube and insert the tube end into the solution near the beaker’s bottom.\n4. Operation: Gently pass SO₂ gas through the solution for several seconds.\nObservation: As gas bubbles rise, the bright magenta color of the fuchsin solution gradually diminishes and ultimately becomes colorless.\nPrinciple Summary: Sulfur dioxide acts as a reducing agent and converts the colored fuchsin (containing quinoid structure) to its reduced, colorless leuco form. The chemical change exemplifies inorganic redox behavior of sulfur compounds.\nReaction Equation (simplified): Fuchsin (colored) + SO₂ + H₂O → Leucofuchsin (colorless) + H₂SO₃\nPrecautions: Conduct the experiment under ventilation due to toxic SO₂ gas.

Objective: To demonstrate the reversible equilibrium between ferric ions and thiocyanate ions through color changes, understanding Le Chatelier's principle in inorganic equilibria.  II. Experimental Apparatus  Test tubes (2), droppers, beakers, stirring rod, ferric chloride solution (FeCl3, pale yellow, 0.1mol/L), potassium thiocyanate solution (KSCN, colorless, 0.1mol/L), distilled water, safety goggles.  III. Experimental Operation Steps  1. Preparation: Wear goggles. Ensure all glassware is clean and dry.  2. Add 2 mL of pale yellow FeCl3 solution into a clean test tube.  3. Add 1 drop of colorless KSCN solution into the test tube and gently mix: the solution turns blood red, forming the ferric thiocyanate complex [Fe(SCN)]2+.  4. Add a few milliliters of distilled water to the red solution. Observe the red color become lighter, showing that dilution shifts equilibrium backward.  5. Add a few more drops of FeCl3 solution; the red color deepens again, indicating equilibrium shift forward.  6. Clean equipment and properly dispose of waste liquids.  IV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena  Initial state: pale yellow FeCl3 and colorless KSCN solutions.  Upon mixing: immediate blood-red color appears.  After adding water: red color fades noticeably.  After adding more FeCl3: red color restores to deeper shade.  V. Summary of Experimental Principles  This reaction demonstrates a reversible equilibrium: Fe3+ + SCN− ⇌ [Fe(SCN)]2+. The deep red complex [Fe(SCN)]2+ is stable in equilibrium with its ionic species. When water is added, the concentration of ions decreases, shifting equilibrium backward (fading color). Adding more FeCl3 increases Fe3+ concentration, shifting equilibrium forward (deepening color). The experiment exemplifies Le Chatelier’s principle—that equilibrium shifts to counteract changes in concentration."

Objective: Compare reaction intensities of weak and strong acids with magnesium to observe hydrogen gas evolution and understand the relationship between acid strength and metal reactivity. Equipment: Test tubes (2, 15×150mm), test tube rack, droppers, labels, magnesium strips (clean and dry, about 3cm each), acetic acid solution (~1M), hydrochloric acid solution (~1M), safety goggles. Procedure: Step 1: Prepare two clean labeled test tubes, each 1/3 filled with respective acid solution. Step 2: Put on safety goggles. Step 3: Insert a magnesium strip into each tube simultaneously and place them back on the rack. Step 4: Observe reaction immediately and compare bubble strength between tubes. Step 5: After the reaction slows, safely dispose of the liquids in a waste container and clean apparatus. Observation of Phenomena: (1) At start, solutions are clear, magnesium metallic gray. (2) After immersion, small bubbles release from magnesium. (3) In hydrochloric acid, bubbles appear rapidly and intensely; in acetic acid, less vigorous evolution occurs. (4) Some fogging near surface may appear due to hydrogen gas. Experimental Principle: Acids react with metals like magnesium to produce soluble salts and hydrogen gas. Reaction equations: Hydrochloric Acid: Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂↑; Acetic Acid: Mg + 2CH₃COOH → (CH₃COO)₂Mg + H₂↑. Because HCl is a stronger acid providing more free hydrogen ions, its reaction proceeds faster than with weak acetic acid.

Core Operation: Use a dropper to slowly add sodium chloride solution into the silver nitrate solution while gently stirring with a glass rod.\n3. Observation: Carefully observe the solution's appearance during and after addition.\n4.

Cleanup: Collect the waste solution and precipitate into the designated waste container. Clean glassware thoroughly.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Before mixing: Both solutions are clear and colorless.\n2. After mixing: A white, curdy precipitate appears immediately and disperses throughout the solution, turning it milky. Upon standing, the precipitate gradually settles to the bottom, with a clear layer above.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThis is a typical double displacement (metathesis) reaction in inorganic chemistry. When aqueous silver nitrate and sodium chloride are mixed, silver ions (Ag⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) combine to produce insoluble silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate, while sodium ions (Na⁺) and nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) remain in solution as spectator ions.\nChemical Reaction Equation:\nAgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s)↓ + NaNO₃(aq)\nThe white AgCl precipitate confirms the occurrence of ionic exchange and validates the solubility rules: chlorides are soluble except for Ag⁺, Pb²⁺, and Hg₂²⁺.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Handle all solutions carefully to avoid contamination.\n2. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight, as silver chloride is photosensitive and may darken upon light absorption.\n3. Dispose of silver waste properly; do not pour it into sink drains.\n4.

Summary of Experimental Principles\nActivated carbon has a large specific surface area and numerous micro-pores, which enable it to adsorb molecules from liquids and gases. The color fading of the red ink solution occurs because the dye molecules adhere to the surface of the activated charcoal by physical adsorption forces (van der Waals attraction). This demonstrates the strong adsorption capacity of porous materials for soluble colored molecules.\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Stir gently to avoid splashing or over-suspension of charcoal.\n2. Ensure complete filtration before observation of the final filtrate.\n3.

Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Wear goggles, check gas connections for leaks, ensure CuO powder is dry and evenly placed at the bottom of the test tube.\nConnection Setup: Insert rubber stopper with gas inlet tube tightly into test tube mouth; outlet tubing leads into water in a beaker to absorb exhaust.\nGas Test: Before heating, release hydrogen briefly to expel air from tube, ignite escaping hydrogen at outlet to ensure pure hydrogen flow, then extinguish flame near outlet.\nCore Operation: Start heating the portion of the test tube containing CuO using a gentle blue flame while hydrogen continues passing through.\nObservation: Watch the color change of CuO from black to reddish-brown as the reduction proceeds; small droplets of water vapor appear and condense at the cooler region of the test tube.\nOperation End: Stop heating after full color change, maintain hydrogen flow for a few seconds, then turn off gas and remove heat source.\nCleanup: When cooled, open system to air slowly, inspect reddish-brown copper solid, and clean all apparatus after confirming cooling.\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Before heating: CuO is black powder.\n2. During heating: black color gradually changes to reddish-brown; water vapor appears and condenses.\n3. After reaction: solid completely turns reddish-brown indicating metallic copper, with clear water droplets observed.\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nIn this reaction, hydrogen acts as a reducing agent and CuO as oxidizing agent. Hydrogen reduces copper(II) oxide to copper while itself oxidized to water. The color change indicates the transformation from CuO (black) to Cu (reddish-brown). Main reaction equation: CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O.\nVI. Safety and Precautions\n1. Ensure hydrogen outlet ignition is performed safely to confirm complete air removal.\n2. Never stop hydrogen flow before removing heat to prevent backfire.\n3. Handle glassware only after cooling to avoid burns.\n4. Avoid excessive flame intensity to prevent tube cracking."

"manual": "Experiment Title: Redox Reaction of KMnO₄ and Oxalic Acid\nSubject: Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry\nObjective: To observe the redox reaction between potassium permanganate and oxalic acid, understanding reciprocal oxidation-reduction changes and mastering colorimetric identification of reaction progress.\nEquipment: Test tube (1), test tube rack, dropper, graduated cylinder, heating source (alcohol lamp or electric heater), potassium permanganate solution (0.02 M, deep purple), oxalic acid solution (0.1 M, colorless), safety goggles.\nProcedure: 1) Add about 5 mL KMnO₄ solution into clean test tube. 2) Use dropper to add 2-3 mL oxalic acid solution. 3) Slightly warm test tube over lamp flame while gently shaking. 4) Observe color change until solution becomes nearly colorless. 5) Remove heat and allow cooling.\nObservation: Initially, solution is deep purple. On gentle heating, color gradually lightens and finally becomes colorless or very pale pink, sometimes accompanied by slight gas bubble formation near glass walls.\nPrinciple Summary: In this redox reaction, oxalic acid is oxidized to carbon dioxide while permanganate ion (MnO₄⁻) is reduced to Mn²⁺ in acidic medium. Core equation: 2MnO₄⁻ + 5C₂O₄²⁻ + 16H⁺ → 2Mn²⁺ + 10CO₂ + 8H₂O. Heating accelerates ion collision, promoting redox completion manifested as disappearance of purple color. Safety Note: Handle acids carefully and avoid direct flame exposure; wear goggles during heating."
