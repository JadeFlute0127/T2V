        "pc_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n1. Video should first show a clean copper sheet being held with tongs before heating.\n2. Then show the copper sheet being placed into a flame.\n3. Next scene should highlight color transformation from reddish metallic to black oxide surface.\nPrinciples:\n- The apparatus (burner, tongs, copper sheet) and heating sequence must match typical inorganic chemistry practice.\n- Color details of copper (reddish) and oxide layer (black) must conform to chemical knowledge.\n- Step order (hold copper → heat → color change) must follow copper oxidation process logic.",
        "cmp_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n1. Initial copper sheet must appear shiny reddish metal.\n2. Upon heating, surface must gradually darken and become black.\nPrinciples:\n- The visual change of color represents formation of CuO, conforming to subject background.\n- No spurious phenomena such as melting or smoke inconsistent with normal copper heating in air.\n- The temperature range shown should visually correspond to typical Bunsen flame heating; brightness of flame and timing of change should reflect real oxidation process.",
        "slr_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n- Spatial continuity: The copper sheet should remain stationary with respect to the flame throughout heating.\n- Temporal continuity: Color change must occur gradually and smoothly.\nPrinciples:\n- Temporal Logic: Heating duration and progressive oxidation should appear continuous over time.\n- Spatial Logic: The burner flame should contact copper at the correct position and cause realistic lighting and reflection changes.\n- Spatiotemporal Consistency: Movement of hand or tongs should logically correspond with heating duration and object transformation.",
        "clr_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n- Heating action must directly cause oxide formation.\nPrinciples:\n- State Causal Logic: Color change results from heating-induced oxidation.\n- Scientific Principle Logic: Combustion in air leads to reaction between Cu and O₂ forming CuO; causal chain shown must reflect this with no irrelevant steps.\n- Presentation: Cause (flame heating) and effect (surface blackening) should be intuitively visible.",
        "ri_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n- Physical properties of copper, flame, and tongs should remain consistent throughout experiment.\nPrinciples:\n- Objects: Copper retains solid state under normal flame; materials hold realistic appearance consistent with physics.\n- Humans: Hand and tongs movements remain natural, without physically impossible distortions or inconsistencies."

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Burning of Copper Sheet in Air\n2. Subject: Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry\n3. Experiment Objective: To investigate the chemical change that occurs when a copper sheet is heated in air, observe the formation of copper oxide, and understand the oxidation reaction of metals.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nCopper sheet (1 piece, 1×3 cm, cleaned and polished), alcohol lamp or Bunsen burner, tongs, heat-resistant pad, safety goggles.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\n1. Preparation Stage: Put on safety goggles. Clean the copper sheet with sandpaper until its surface becomes bright and free of oxide layers.\n2. Core Operation: Hold the copper sheet with tongs. Ignite the alcohol lamp or Bunsen burner, adjust to a steady hot flame. Place the copper sheet at the outer flame, heating evenly for about 30–60 seconds, maintaining direct exposure of the metal surface to air.\n3. Observation: Closely watch the color change on the copper surface during heating.\n4. Conclusion: After the reaction, remove the copper sheet, place it on the heat-resistant pad, and allow it to cool. Observe the surface coloration again. Clean up the apparatus after completion.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Before heating: The copper sheet is shiny and reddish metallic in color.\n2. During heating: The surface gradually changes color. First, it darkens slightly, and then becomes coated with a black layer due to oxidation.\n3. After cooling: The copper sheet shows a stable black coating on its surface, indicating the formation of copper(II) oxide.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nWhen copper is heated in air, it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form black copper(II) oxide. This process is an oxidation reaction representing the combination of a metal with oxygen.\nReaction equation: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\nThe color change from red to black reflects the formation of a new substance, confirming a chemical change. The black substance is solid CuO, which differs in properties from copper metal, demonstrating the transformation from element to compound in an inorganic reaction.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. The copper sheet must be clean before heating for a distinct observable phenomenon.\n2. Operate at a safe distance from the flame and use tongs to avoid burns.\n3. Do not overheat to melting; the goal is oxidation, not melting.\n4. After completion, ensure the flame is extinguished safely and equipment returned properly."
