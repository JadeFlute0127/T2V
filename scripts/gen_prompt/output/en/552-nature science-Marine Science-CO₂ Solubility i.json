    "generation_prompt": "CO₂ Solubility in Seawater vs. Temperature: A lab setup with two beakers, each filled with clear seawater at different temperatures (one with ice to remain cold, the other heated via a hot plate). A tube connected to a CO₂ gas source slowly bubbles gas into each beaker. In the cold beaker, large amounts of bubbles dissolve quickly with minimal escape to the surface. In the warm beaker, more bubbles rise to the surface and escape. Camera shows close-up of bubble dissolution contrast and temperature labels, highlighting faster CO₂ loss in warm water.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: CO₂ Solubility in Seawater vs. Temperature\n2. Subject: Nature Science - Marine Science\n3. Experiment Objective: To demonstrate the difference in CO₂ solubility in seawater at varying temperatures, understand the effect of temperature on gas solubility, and relate findings to marine carbon cycle processes.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nTwo clear beakers (500 mL), seawater samples, thermometer, crushed ice, hot plate, CO₂ gas source with regulator, delivery tubing, safety goggles, lab gloves.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Place both beakers on a lab bench. Fill each with 300 mL of seawater. Place ice in one beaker to maintain a temperature near 5°C, and set the other beaker on a hot plate to achieve ~35°C. Measure and record temperatures with thermometers.\nCore Operation: Connect the CO₂ source to a delivery tube. Insert the tubing into each beaker separately and bubble CO₂ for 30 seconds in each, keeping tube submerged. Observe bubble behavior in each temperature condition.\nObservation: Note dissolution rate and escape rate of CO₂ bubbles in cold vs. warm seawater.\nExperiment Conclusion: Turn off CO₂ supply, remove tubing, and record observations. Dispose of seawater in designated waste container; clean all apparatus.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Cold seawater: CO₂ bubbles dissolve rapidly, fewer bubbles rise to surface.\n2. Warm seawater: CO₂ bubbles dissolve slowly, more rise and escape into air.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nGas solubility in liquids decreases with increasing temperature. Cold seawater holds more dissolved CO₂; warm seawater loses CO₂ more readily to the atmosphere. In marine environments, this affects carbon cycling and atmospheric CO₂ levels.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n- Maintain clear temperature difference between beakers.\n- Do not overheat seawater (risk of boiling).\n- Ensure delivery tube remains submerged during gas introduction.\n- Follow safety protocols with CO₂ handling."
