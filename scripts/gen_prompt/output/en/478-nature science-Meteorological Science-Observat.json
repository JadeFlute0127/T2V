Close-up of butterfly wings: low-latitude wings appear lighter with larger reflective scales; high-latitude wings appear darker and denser in pigmentation. Gradually zoom out to compare color differences on both wings side by side, highlighting the latitudinal gradient and environmental temperature influence.",

The comparative conclusion scene should directly follow the environmental data presentation. Principles: 1.

No unrelated cause chains interfere with visual demonstration; the comparison must intuitively convey adaptation. 3. Scientific logic consistency with environmental biology knowledge.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Observations on Butterfly Wing Color with Latitude (15°N and 55°N)\n2. Subject: Nature Science - Meteorological Science\n3. Experiment Objective: To observe the relationship between latitude-related climatic conditions and butterfly wing coloration, understand how temperature and solar radiation affect color density and pigmentation adaptability, and apply meteorological knowledge to biological observation.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nTwo glass display cases (each containing butterfly specimens representative of local species), white LED light source (standard illumination), digital thermometer and hygrometer, color comparison chart, magnifying lens or digital microscope, and labeled backdrop with longitude/latitude markings (15°N, 55°N).\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Arrange two clean glass cases on the laboratory table under identical controlled lighting (white LED, illumination intensity ≈1000 lux). Set a thermometer near each case to indicate typical ambient temperature (low latitude 28°C; high latitude 12°C).\nSpecimen Setup: Place butterfly specimens collected or photographically printed from low-latitude and high-latitude environments, ensuring wings are fully spread and visible. Label each case accordingly.\nCore Observation: Using a magnifying lens or microscope, focus on the wing scales. Record wing coloration appearance, including brightness, color hue, and pattern density. Compare both specimens side by side, noting visual distinctions while keeping lighting and angle constant.\nRecording and Comparison: Observe that low-latitude butterflies display lighter, more reflective wing surfaces; high-latitude butterflies exhibit darker, denser coloration. Document visually with notes or digital images.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initial State: Both specimens display distinct wing colors when observed under identical light intensity.\n2. Phenomena: Low-latitude (15°N) butterflies exhibit bright, less pigmented wings—lighter tones and more reflective scales. High-latitude (55°N) butterflies present darker pigmentation with denser scales.\n3. Relationship: The observed color difference correlates with local temperature and solar radiation intensity—higher latitude corresponds to lower temperature and darker wing coloration due to thermal and radiative adaptation.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nButterfly wing coloration is influenced by latitude-related meteorological factors including temperature, solar radiation, and humidity. At low latitudes, stronger radiation encourages lighter coloration that reflects excess heat. At high latitudes, cooler environments and reduced solar exposure promote darker coloration for heat absorption. This demonstrates the interaction between biological adaptation and meteorological conditions. The principle relies on heat balance and radiation absorption, forming a clear latitudinal gradient of pigmentation.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Ensure both specimens receive identical lighting conditions to prevent misleading color differences due to illumination.\n2. Avoid touching wings directly to prevent damage to scales.\n3. Maintain suitable environmental stability; avoid wind or excessive humidity changes during observation.\n4. When photographing, use consistent camera exposure so comparison reflects true color difference.\n"
