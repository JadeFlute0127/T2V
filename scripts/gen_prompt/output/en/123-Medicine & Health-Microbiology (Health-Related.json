    "generation_prompt": "Yersinia enterocolitica Detection (Colorimetric Method). Scene begins with a microbiology laboratory bench under clean lighting. A researcher wearing gloves and a lab coat prepares sterile equipment. Glass test tubes labeled with samples are placed beside a micropipette and reagent bottles. The researcher pipettes a diluted bacterial sample into a test tube containing a colorimetric reagent specific for Yersinia enterocolitica enzymes. After gentle mixing and incubation in a water bath at 37°C for a short period (accelerated process), the solution gradually changes color—from pale yellow to bright red—indicating a positive detection. The result tube is compared visually to a control tube that remains colorless. The camera focuses on the two tubes showing the color difference, demonstrating the detection principle clearly.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Yersinia enterocolitica Detection (Colorimetric Method)\n2. Subject: Medicine & Health - Microbiology (Health-Related)\n3. Experiment Objective: To detect the presence of Yersinia enterocolitica in a sample using a colorimetric reagent based on the enzymatic activity of the bacterium; understand the visual cue of color change that indicates a positive detection and the underlying biochemical principle.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nTest tubes (15×150 mm), micropipette and sterile tips, colorimetric reagent specific to Yersinia enterocolitica (substrate producing color in presence of bacterial enzyme), sterile sample diluent, water bath/incubator set to 37°C, rack for tubes, gloves, lab coat, goggles.\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Wear protective equipment (gloves, coat, goggles). Label two test tubes: Sample and Control. \nSample Addition: Using a micropipette, transfer a measured volume (e.g., 1 mL) of the suspected sample into the Sample tube. Add the same volume of sterile diluent to the Control tube.\nReagent Addition: Add equal drops of the colorimetric reagent to each tube using sterile technique. Gently flick or mix the tubes to ensure uniform mixing.\nIncubation: Place both tubes into a water bath or incubator at 37°C for 30 minutes (or shortened duration for demonstration).\nObservation: Remove tubes and visually compare color changes: the sample tube may change color depending on bacterial enzymatic activity.\nTermination: Record observations, dispose of biological waste per lab regulations, and clean equipment.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initial State: Both tubes contain pale yellow transparent reagent solution with similar appearance.\n2. During Reaction: The sample tube slowly exhibits color enhancement, turning orange-red due to enzymatic conversion of the substrate. The control tube remains pale yellow.\n3. End of Reaction: The difference in color intensity between sample and control becomes distinct; bright red indicates presence of Yersinia enterocolitica, no color change means absence.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThis experiment applies the principle that Yersinia enterocolitica produces specific enzymes capable of catalyzing a chromogenic substrate. In the colorimetric method, a noncolored substrate reacts enzymatically to yield a colored product when bacterial enzymes are present. Thus, color change in the reagent indicates enzymatic activity and presence of Yersinia enterocolitica.\n1. Core Principle: Enzyme-mediated substrate color conversion reflects microbial presence.\n2. Analytical Logic: Comparison between control and test ensures specificity—only bacterial enzyme activity causes visible change.\n3. Application: Colorimetric assays are safe, rapid, and suitable for preliminary pathogen screening.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Maintain sterile conditions to avoid contamination.\n2. Do not inhale near open test tubes; use gloves and goggles always.\n3. Ensure temperature stability during incubation for enzymatic reaction accuracy.\n4. Observe color precisely under good illumination and record within 5 minutes post incubation.\n5. Dispose of biological and chemical waste in designated containers following biosafety protocols."
