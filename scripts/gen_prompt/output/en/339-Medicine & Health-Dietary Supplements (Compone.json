    "generation_prompt": "Glycine Detection (Ninhydrin–Ethyl Acetate Method): In a brightly lit laboratory scene, a researcher wearing gloves and goggles places a small test tube on a rack. The test tube contains a clear solution of glycine in ethyl acetate. Using a dropper, the researcher adds a few drops of freshly prepared ninhydrin reagent. The test tube is gently heated in a water bath. As the heating proceeds, the solution gradually changes color from colorless to light purple, showing the formation of Ruhemann’s purple complex characteristic of amino acid detection. Steam lightly rises from the water bath, and the researcher observes the color change closely under the bench lamp.",

    "manual": "Instructions for the Experiment \\\"Glycine Detection (Ninhydrin–Ethyl Acetate Method)\\\"\n\nI. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Glycine Detection (Ninhydrin–Ethyl Acetate Method)\n2. Subject: Medicine & Health – Dietary Supplements (Component Testing)\n3. Experiment Objective: To detect and verify the presence of glycine in a dietary supplement sample using the ninhydrin colorimetric reaction with ethyl acetate as solvent, and to understand the chemical principle behind amino acid detection via color change.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\n- Test tubes (clean, dry)\n- Test tube rack\n- Dropper or pipette\n- Ninhydrin solution (0.2% in ethyl acetate, freshly prepared)\n- Glycine sample or dietary supplement extract containing glycine\n- Water bath (70–90°C)\n- Ethyl acetate solvent\n- Safety goggles, gloves\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\nPreparation Stage: Put on safety goggles and gloves. Clean all glassware and place a test tube securely on a test tube rack. Prepare a glycine solution by dissolving a small amount of sample extract in ethyl acetate.\n\nReagent Addition: Use a dropper to add 1–2 mL of the ninhydrin solution into the test tube containing glycine solution. Gently shake or swirl the test tube to ensure uniform mixing without splashing.\n\nReaction Initiation: Place the test tube into a water bath maintained at approximately 80°C for about 2–3 minutes. Keep the test tube upright and avoid direct flame heating.\n\nObservation: Observe the solution during heating. Initially colorless, the solution gradually turns light purple as the reaction proceeds. Continue heating until the purple coloration fully develops.\n\nCompletion: Remove the test tube, allow to cool, and compare the color intensity to a blank (ethyl acetate + ninhydrin without glycine). Dispose of waste properly and clean all glassware upon completion.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initial State: The glycine solution in ethyl acetate is colorless and transparent.\n2. Upon Heating: After addition of ninhydrin and gentle heating, the solution begins to develop a faint purple color.\n3. Final State: The solution becomes distinctly purple, indicating the presence of glycine or other primary amino acids.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThe ninhydrin reaction is a classic qualitative test for amino acids and peptides. Glycine reacts with ninhydrin in ethyl acetate upon heating to yield Ruhemann’s purple, a colored complex. The intensity and development of purple coloration are proportional to amino acid presence.\nChemical Principle: Two ninhydrin molecules react with the amino group of glycine, forming the chromophore (Ruhemann’s purple).\nThis method is widely used in biochemical and health supplement testing to identify amino compounds qualitatively.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Prepare ninhydrin reagent fresh to ensure optimal reaction sensitivity.\n2. Avoid overheating to prevent solvent evaporation or reagent decomposition.\n3. Perform the experiment in a ventilated area; ethyl acetate is volatile.\n4. Handle chemicals with gloves and goggles to ensure safety.\n5. Dispose of organic waste according to institutional chemical waste protocols.\n"
