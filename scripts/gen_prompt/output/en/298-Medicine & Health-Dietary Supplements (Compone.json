    "generation_prompt": "Vitamin B7 Detection (Colorimetric Method). A laboratory demonstration showing the detection of vitamin B7 in a dietary supplement sample using a colorimetric assay. On the lab bench, a white ceramic tile, several test tubes labeled ‘Sample’, ‘Blank’, and ‘Standard’, a pipette, reagent droppers, and a heater are neatly arranged. The experimenter uses the pipette to transfer the supplement extract and reagent into the test tubes, places them in a warm-water bath for a short time. The color of the ‘Sample’ tube gradually changes from colorless to pale pink, while the ‘Blank’ remains colorless. The final visual comparison shows darker pink intensity with increasing vitamin B7 concentration.",

The experimenter must sequentially perform reagent addition, heating, and color comparison according to process order.\nPrinciples:\n- Apparatus arrangement and colorimetric reaction steps must conform to biochemical testing norms.\n- Apparatus color, size, and shape must match those typically used in analytical chemistry experiments.\n- The visual expression of color change must correspond to realistic vitamin detection conditions.",
        "cmp_rubic": "Hard Rules:\n1. The ‘Sample’ tube should visibly change color from colorless to pale pink after heating.\n2. The ‘Blank’ should remain colorless throughout the experiment.\nPrinciples:\n- The appearance of a pink hue signifies vitamin B7 presence and should be distinguishable from background illumination.\n- The order of observed phenomena (color appearing post-heating) must align with standard chemical reaction timelines.",

The transition between adding reagent, heating, and observing color must be continuous and plausible.\nPrinciples:\n- Temporal Logic: Color change should occur gradually, not instantaneously.\n- Spatial Logic: The setup and lighting should realistically represent a laboratory workspace.\n- Spatiotemporal Consistency: Reagent mixing and heat induction cause observable changes over a practical timespan.",

Reagent addition and subsequent heating must causally result in color formation.\nPrinciples:\n- The color change is causally linked to vitamin B7 reacting with chromogenic reagent.\n- The experiment must reflect biochemical principle logic: complex formation yields a pigment proportional to concentration.\n- Presentation of causal chain must be direct and intuitive, clearly showing operator action leading to result.",

    "manual": "I. Basic Experiment Information\n1. Experiment Title: Vitamin B7 Detection (Colorimetric Method)\n2. Subject: Medicine & Health - Dietary Supplements (Component Testing)\n3. Experiment Objective: To identify and semi-quantify vitamin B7 (biotin) in dietary supplements using a colorimetric reaction, understand basic detection principles, and master visual comparison technique for concentration estimation.\n\nII. Experimental Equipment\nTest tubes (3, labeled Sample, Blank, Standard), pipette, reagent droppers, warm-water bath (50°C), color comparison tile, measuring cylinder, safety goggles, gloves, vitamin B7 reagent (chromogenic reagent, freshly prepared).\n\nIII. Experimental Procedure\n1. Preparation Stage: Wear safety goggles and gloves. Set three clean dry test tubes on the rack and label them: Sample, Blank, and Standard.\n2. Solution Preparation: Pipette 2.0 mL of supplement extract into the Sample tube; 2.0 mL of distilled water into the Blank; 2.0 mL of vitamin B7 standard solution into the Standard tube.\n3. Reagent Addition: Add 1.0 mL of chromogenic reagent into each tube using a dropper. Mix gently by tapping.\n4. Heating Step: Place all tubes in a warm-water bath at 50°C for 3–5 minutes to accelerate the color development.\n5. Observation: Remove tubes and place on a white tile. Observe color differences among the three tubes.\n6. Cleanup: Pour test solutions into the designated waste container, rinse equipment thoroughly, and dry before storage.\n\nIV. Observation of Experimental Phenomena\n1. Initial State: All three test solutions are colorless and transparent.\n2. After Reagent Addition: No immediate color change is observed at room temperature.\n3. After Heating: The Sample solution gradually develops a pale pink color; the Standard solution displays a stronger pink tone, and the Blank remains colorless.\n4. Final State: Visible color intensity correlates with vitamin B7 concentration in each tube.\n\nV. Summary of Experimental Principles\nThe colorimetric detection of vitamin B7 is based on its reaction with a specific reagent forming a colored complex after mild heating. The color intensity is proportional to biotin concentration within the sample. By comparing with a known standard, the biotin content in the supplement can be qualitatively and semi-quantitatively determined. The heating step accelerates complex formation, ensuring visible color development suitable for visual evaluation.\n\nVI. Experimental Precautions\n1. Maintain consistent reagent volumes to ensure accurate comparison.\n2. Avoid overheating above 60°C to prevent reagent decomposition.\n3. Ensure complete cleaning to prevent cross-contamination.\n4. Handle all reagents with gloves, maintaining laboratory safety protocols."
